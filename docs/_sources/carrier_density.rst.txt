Carrier density
============================================

In this page, we derive the classical and quantum mechanical carrier densities.

Classical carrier densities cannot deal with quantum effects, such as enegy quantization, and carrier leakage into a barrier.

Quantum mechanical carrier density
-----------------------------------
In quantum mechanics, the carrier density can be obtained by solving Schr√∂dinger equation.
